#### What is it ?

-	LLDB, is a program ‚Äì that provides an interface for you to examine the execution of a program ‚Äì instruction by instruction, or line by line, or breakpoint by breakpoint.

	> More detailed:
	>
	> LLDB, short for ***Low-Level-De-Bugger***, is a program ‚Äì **that provides an interface** *(a way/channel/portal/access-point/control-panel)* **for you to examine the execution** *([individual] actions/steps taken-by/performed-by)* **of a** *[-nother]* **program** ‚Äì *[CPU]* **instruction by instruction, or** *[source code]* **line by line, or breakpoint** *(checkpoint(s) set by you, in the source code)* **by breakpoint.** <br>

- "`lldb` is the default debugger in Xcode on macOS and supports debugging C, Objective-C and C++ on the desktop and iOS devices and simulator."

#### Why should I care ?

-	*The short answer;* you should care because it will save you *(***THOUSANDS*** of)* hours of [debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging) ‚Äì the process of locating [bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) *[in source code]*, finding their cause(s) and [patching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)) (i.e fixing/removing) them.

-	***To see source code in the *"examination phase"**** *(instead of assembly code)*, you'll have to add *[in the compilation step]* the *[compiler]* flag *(specific to the compiler used)* that ***generates debug information***; but if your goal is to see *assembly*, then omit this step.

	> For `clang` and `gcc` *[compilers]*, the flag is: `-g`.

-	***To make sure that no source code is not optimized away*** *(i.e modified by the compiler in order to optimize the [speed and efficiency of a] program)*, you'll have to add *[in the compilation step]* the *[compiler]* flag *(specific to the compiler used)* that ***turns off optimizations***; if you don't do this, then during *"examination phase"*, `lldb` might appear to be excuting *[the source code]* in a non-linear manner *(i.e it will (seem to) jump (skip) over some lines and loops, etc)*.

	> For `clang` and `gcc` *[compilers]*, the flag is: `-O0`

> *This section is unrelated to LLDB, but related to debugging.*

-	The `fsanitize` family of *[compiler]* flags, is an extraordinarily helpful set of *[compiler]* flags, with regards to debugging. They enable *[compiler]* *[runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_(program_lifecycle_phase))* checks¬†‚Äì‚Äì *which are disabled by default* ‚Äì‚Äì that detect and help avoid bugs. If a check fails, a diagnostic message is produced *(at runtime)* explaining the problem.

	Each *[sanitizer]* performs multiple *(different)* checks, for example: the *UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer* ‚Äì‚Äì enabled by *`-fsanitize=undefined`* ‚Äì‚Äì performs all the checks listed [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/code_diagnostics/undefined_behavior_sanitizer#topics) (or [here](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html#available-checks) (just another good resource)).

	> *<small>[**Note:** For the better diagnostic messages, compile with the `-g` [compiler] flag; the `-O0` [compiler] flag comes naturally along as well, to disable [compiler] optimizations. - **end note**]</small>*

-	***Enable sanitizer** [checks] **:***

-	`lldb` must *[then]* be informed of which program we intend to debug ‚Äì this step is referred to as: ***"loading a program"*** . The following subsection explores the basic commands ([¬ß3.3.1](#331-basics)) of loading programs. <br>

	> In `lldb`'s lexicon, a ***"program [executable] intended for debugging"*** is a referred to as a ***"[debugger] target"***.
	>
	> So technically you could say; we are ***loading*** *[`lldb` with]* a ***debugger target***; i.e setting *[`lldb`]* up to target a specific process *(program)*, for debugging/examination-phase.

## 3.4. Setup LLDB

-	`lldb` *[then]* gives you the possibility of setting up [*breakpoints*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint) ([¬ß3.4.1](#341-breakpoints))¬†‚Äì‚Äì locations in your program to pause execution at *[and examine the current state of things]* ‚Äì‚Äì and [*watchpoints*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/watchpoint#English) ([¬ß3.4.2](#342-watchpoints)) ‚Äì‚Äì a logger, for certain variables and/or memory-regions, logging *[incoming]* operations (`reads` & `writes`).

<!-- BREAKPOINT ANALOGY:

-	An analogy *(a situation/narrative same, or resembling, in essence)* *[for the above concepts]* would be that of city *metros or buses*. The *bus* *(**`lldb`**)* stops at designated *bus stops* *(**breakpoints**)*. The *bus stops* are known by *address or reference number* *(**a particular line, in a *[source code]* file**)*, they may also be known by *(a significant) structure/building, junction or area* *(**a particular function [in your code]**)*. Sometimes the *bus* doesn't stop at a particular *bus stop*, because conditions have been tied to it; the *bus* only stops at the *bus stop* at certain hours and/or certain days of the week; i.e the bus stopping at that station is conditional, i.e relies on certain ***condition(s)*** being met, e.g: *"in the morning hours (6am-11am), if it is a weekday"* *(`if (morning == true && (week_day >= 0 && week_day <= 5))`)*.

>	*"In software development, a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a 'pause'.*
>
>	*More generally, a breakpoint is a means of acquiring knowledge about a program during its execution. During the interruption, the programmer inspects the test environment (general purpose registers, memory, logs, files, etc.) to find out whether the program is functioning as expected. In practice, a breakpoint consists of one or more conditions that determine when a program's execution should be interrupted. [...]"*

The following subsections dive into the ***basic*** ([¬ß3.4.1.1](#3411-basics)) as well as [slightly] more ***advanced commands*** ([¬ß3.4.1.2](#3412-advanced-commands)) *[for operating on breakpoints]*, then into the available ***breakpoint options*** ([¬ß3.4.1.3](#3413-options)) and how to utilise them, also, we discover the [amazing] usefulness and power of ***breakpoint names*** ([¬ß3.4.1.4](#3414-names)) and that of configuring their options, additionally we briefly see the breakpoint facilites for multi-threaded programs ([¬ß3.4.1.5](#3415-multi-threaded-programs)) and, finally, a few ***C++** ([¬ß3.4.1.6](#3416-c-programs)) [specific] **breakpoint commands***.

		> *<small>[**Note**:*

		> - In this case, since there is a reference to a global variable, `bp_count`, you will also need to make sure `bp_count` exists and is initialized:

		>
		> 	Your Python code, however organized, can optionally return a value. If the returned value is `False`, that tells LLDB not to stop at the breakpoint to which the code is associated. Returning anything other than `False`, or even returning None, or even omitting a return statement entirely, will cause `lldb` to stop.

***Breakpoint name*** is an extremely powerful *[`lldb`]* feature. It allows us to create a breakpoint "profile", so to speak, ‚Äì‚Äì a set, of breakpoint options ‚Äì‚Äì referrable by `name`. Later on, when we create *(`set`)* breakpoints, we can choose to have them *[the breakpoints we are creating (`set`'ing)]* inherit *(have added to their list of `names`)* one or more *[profile]* `names`, i.e one or more of these *[pre-defined]* sets of options. Any modification to a *[breakpoint]* profile immediately applies to all breakpoints that inherit that profile *(have that [profile] `name` in their list of [profile] `names`)*.

Breakpoint `names` *(profiles)* live independantly of breakpoints that inherit them, and *[existent]* breakpoints all together, allowing them to persist even after all breakpoints are deleted. Down below are discussed the breakpoint commands used to **create** / **list** / **delete** / **configure** breakpoint `names` *(profiles)* and how to make your breakpoint(s) inherit/be-named *(have added to their list of `names` *(profiles)*)* a `name` *(profile)*.

> *For more on **breakpoint names**, and why they are the best, powerful and modular way of using breakpoints, see: [(Official) Tutorial :: Breakpoint Names](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/tutorial.html#breakpoint-names).*

	> ***Brief:***
	>
	> *`breakpoint name configure` allows to configure the options of breakpoints who have in their list of names anyone of the `<breakpoint-names>` provided.*
	>
	> ***Synopsis:***
	> ```shell
	> breakpoint name configure <cmd-options> [<breakpt-name> ...]       # i.e, expanded below
	> breakpoint name configure <condition> [<command> ...] [<attribute> ...] [<breakpt-name> ...]
	> ```
	>
	> ***Example(s):***
	> ```shell
	> (lldb) breakpoint name configure --condition '2 <= ac && ac <= 10' --command bt --command 'fr v' --auto-continue true controlFlow
	> (lldb) br n c -c '2 <= ac && ac <= 10' -C bt -C 'fr v' -G controlFlow
	> ```
	>
	> > *To clarify ‚Äì‚Äì we are asking `lldb` to configure all breakpoints, named `controlFlow`, to break (only) when: `2 <= ac <= 10`, and following a break, to run the following [`lldb`] commands: `bt` and `fr v`, and to then `continue` execution [of the program] automatically.*

	> *<small>[**Note:***
	>
	> - *If you provide a breakpoint id, with the `--breakpoint-id` or `-B` option *[followed by `<breakpt-ids>`]*, the options will be copied from
     the breakpoint, otherwise only the options specified will be set on the name.*

-	There are two ways to start debugging a process (running program):

	-  [`launch`](#351-launch-program)     ‚Äì¬†Launching one ([¬ß3.5.1](#351-launch-program))
	-  [`attach`](#352-attach-to-program)  ‚Äì¬†Attaching to *[an already running]* one ([¬ß3.5.2](#352-attach-to-program))

-	Also, with regards to programs that are `launched gives the possibility of configuring things like: where you want the process to be run *(terminal, shell)*, setting environment variables, setting the current working directory, redirecting `stdin`/`out`/`err`, etc ‚Äì¬†all of which is dicussed in **Advanced Program Configurations** ([¬ß3.5.3](#353-advanced-program-configurations)).

> ***TL;DR:*** <br>
> *"Attach" means, take over control of a process (running program), at the instruction that the process has reached.*

---

> ***FULL:*** <br>
> *Every time you start a new application, you create one or more processes. A process is simply executable code that is loaded into memory. The CPU reads and executes the instructions to perform the tasks you ask the application to do. When the CPU loads your application into memory, it assigns each process the application creates a Process IDentifier (PID), which is pronounced pid (think of lid with a p instead of an l). The PID is simply a number associated with the process for easy identification.*

>	*In most cases, you debug an application by running it in the IDE in debug mode. However, there are some situations where you must debug the application in a different way ‚Äî by attaching to its process. ***Attaching to the process means telling the CPU to send the instructions in the executable code to a debugger before they‚Äôre executed by the CPU.*** In other words, you place the debugger between the executable code and the CPU.*

## About

-	The graphical user interface *[mode of `lldb`]*, or `gui` for short, is what it says it is ‚Äì‚Äì namely, a user interface for `lldb` that is **graphical** *[,¬†rather than textual (**command prompt**)]*.

-	Its advantages are **MASSIVE**. Here are a few:

	- You no longer have to constantly auto/man-ually print the source code, value of variables/registers and backtrace, after every instruction/line executed.
	- You can quickly & with little to no effort navigate through code, variables/registers, threads, stack frames.
	- You can see the value of variables/registers in different formats: from decimal, to hex, to binary, etc...
	- You can enjoy a graphical layout, who doesn't rather have that ? ‚Äì‚Äì *Yeah, cause you're weird.*

	There are more... but this should suffice.

-	*[Anyways]* Here's what it looks like:

	> *This is a small terminal window only in order to be able to make a `gif` who's text is discernable. Realistically, on a bigger terminal screen, it'll look like this:*

	> ![`gui` Demo (Big Screen)](https://media.giphy.com/media/jQUmfQ8eXuWE0L2tMB/giphy.gif)

-	It *[the `gui`]* has 3 *[by default, but up to 4]* screen subdivisions, called views (or window panes):

    | Window Pane            | Description
    | :--------------------- | :-----------------
    | Source                 | Displays, *[currently executing]* and surrounding, *[assembly]* instructions, or if the `-g` flag was used *[in compilation]*, source code.
    | Variables              | Displays variables *[, belonging to the current stack frame, ]* and their currently held values.
    | Registers              | Displays registers *[, belonging to the current stack frame, ]* and their currently held values. <!-- POTENTIAL-MISTAKE: Do stack frames have different registers ? -->
    | Backtrace *(Threads & Stack Frames)* | Displays the process's current threads and their stack frames.

	> *<small>[**Note:***
	>
	> -	*The "registers" window pane is not visible on entry of the `gui`, you must toggle it on, from: `>Source Code View > Top Menu > Views > Registers`.*

## About

After process `launch` / `attach`, `lldb` completely hands over the control of the execution of the process (i.e running program) to you, and it *[`lldb`]* gives you commands with which to control it.

The following subsections will layout the **`lldb` prompt commands** offered to control the program ‚Äì‚Äì¬†not the **graphical user interface commands**, those are laid out in section ([¬ß3.6.2 @ Source Code *[Commands Help Menu]*](#source-code-help-menu)).

| Command | Description
| :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------
||
| `(lldb) continue`  | **Continue execution** *[of all threads in the current process] <br>* *[till a breakpoint is hit or termination of the process is met]*.
| `(lldb) thread until <line>` | **Run until line** `<line>` or control leaves the current function.
||
|  `(lldb) thread step-over` <br> `(lldb) next` <br> `(lldb) n` | **Step over** *[function call]* lines *[, if any]*, executing the current <br> line and stepping, thereafter, over it, to the next one. Defaults to <br> current thread unless specified.
| `(lldb) thread step-in` <br> `(lldb) step` <br> `(lldb) s` | **Step into** *[function]* calls. Defaults to current thread unless <br> specified.
| `(lldb) thread step-out` <br> `(lldb) finish` | **Step out** of the currently selected frame *(i.e function call)*.
||
| `(lldb) kill`      | **Terminate** the current target process.
| `(lldb) detach`    | **Detach** from the current target process.

	- issue with lldb is it takes time to get back to the orginal point

	ex:

		- how to skip loops, cuz it takes too long

		- and be able to see stderr, stdout

		- segfaults when a variable reaches a value of 3
		but it takes time to get there, so how can you
		run the code till it reaches 2 then go line by
		line from there.

	VSCODE Breakpoint Types:

		Expression :: Break when expression evaluates to true.
		Hit-Count  :: Log boolean when expression evaluates to true.
		Logpoint   :: Log <Inputed-Message> when breakpoint is hit.

Glossary of Terms

| Term *[transliterated from Arabic]* | Meaning
| :---------------------------------- | :-----------------------------------------------
| ***(al-)Abad***                     | Eternity in the future
| ***(al-)Azal***                     | Eternity in the past
| ***(al-)‚ÄòAbd***                     | The servant; the servant of God by creation; the servant of God who beliefs in and worships Him
| ***(al-)‚ÄòAdhƒÅb***                   | Punishment. <br> <br> The Qur‚ÄôƒÅn uses seven different names for the places or types of punishment in the Hereafter: Jahannam (Hell), NƒÅr (Fire), Sa‚Äòƒ´r (Blaze), Jahƒ´m (Blazing Flame), Hutamah (Consuming Fire), Saqar (Scorching Fire), and LazƒÅ (Raging Flame). Most probably, these are the levels or degrees of punishment, each prepared for those who deserve it and each having a gate.
| ***(al-)AdhƒÅn***                    | The call to the Prayer. <br> <br> It is as follows: AllƒÅhu akbar (God is the All-Great: 4 times); Ashhadu an lƒÅ ilƒÅha illa‚ÄôllƒÅh (I bear witness that there is no deity but God: twice); Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Ras≈´lu‚ÄôllƒÅh (I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of God: twice); Hayya ‚ÄòalƒÅ‚Äôs-salƒÅh (Come on, to the Prayer: twice), Hayya ‚ÄòalƒÅ‚Äôl-falƒÅh (Come on, to salvation: twice); AllƒÅhu akbar (God is the All-Great: twice); LƒÅ ilƒÅha illa‚ÄôllƒÅh (There is no deity but God: once).
| ***(al-)‚ÄòAfw***                     | Pardoning, granting remission; excusing
| ***(al-)‚ÄòAhd***                     | Covenant; contract
| ***‚ÄòAhdu‚ÄôllƒÅh***                    | God‚Äôs covenant. <br> <br> It is the promise that God has taken from His servants that they should believe in Him and worship Him alone. Besides this cardinal one, God has made different covenants with His Prophets and many peoples in different times.
| ***Ahl al-Bayt***                   | The household. As a term, it refers to the household of the Prophet Muhammad, *(upon him be peace and blessings)*, including FƒÅtimah, his daughter, and her husband, ‚ÄòAli, and their sons, Hasan and Husayn.
| ***Ahl al-KitƒÅb***                  | The People of the Book, that is any people who have been given a Divine Book. The Qur‚ÄôƒÅn tends to use this term particularly for the Jews and Christians. The term also includes the Sabeans and the Magians.
| ***Ahl al-KitƒÅb wa‚Äôs-Sunnah***      | The People of the Book and the Sunnah. They are the Muslims who strive to follow exactly the teachings of the Qur‚Äôan and the way of the Prophet Muhammad *(upon him be peace and blessings)*, as reported by his Companions.
| ***(al-)ƒÄkhirah***                  | The next one; afterlife, the Hereafter. This is the other world where conscious, responsible beings will be called to account for their beliefs and deeds in the world and recompensed for them.
| ***(al-)AhzƒÅb***                    | Parties, confederates. It is particularly used for the remnants of the ancient, destroyed peoples who lived in Arabia during the revelation of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn, and for the confederate forces composed of different tribes that besieged Madƒ´nah and fought the Muslims in the Battle of the Trench in 627 CE 5 a.h. AH.
| ***(al-)ƒÄkif***                     | One who abides in devotion to God
| ***(al-)AkhlƒÅq***                   | The science and principles of good conduct and morality. <br> <br> The most distinguishing characteristic of Islam and, when loyal to that characteristic, of the community of Muhammad *(upon him be peace and blessings)*, is that it is far from all kinds of extremism. Islam represents the middle way in all aspects of life. For example, it is neither spiritualism nor materialism, neither realism nor idealism, neither capitalism nor socialism, neither individualism nor statism, neither absolutism nor anarchism, neither this-worldly and hedonistic, nor purely other-worldly and monastic. As it is unique in its worldview and social, economic and political aspects, it is also unique in the moral education it gives to individuals. Islam aims to develop human beings from being potentially human to being truly human, thus perfecting them. It develops the human character in the best way. The parts of Wisdom which the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn enumerates in CHAPTER? verses 22‚Äì39, beginning and ending with the absolute prohibition of associating partners with God in any way in His Divinity and Lordship, are important in developing that character and raising members of a Muslim society.
| ***(al-)‚ÄòƒÄlam (pl. ‚ÄòƒÅlam≈´n)***      | The world, worlds. The word comes from ‚Äòalam, ‚ÄòalƒÅmah, meaning something by which another thing is known. Thus, in this perspective, every individual thing or set of things, from the tiniest sub-atomic particles to the largest nebulae and galaxies, is a ‚Äúworld‚Äù and indicates God. The plural form (‚ÄòƒÅlam≈´n) is particularly used for conscious beings, giving the sense that everything that is created is as if conscious, and signifying that its pointing to God‚Äôs Existence, Unity and Lordship is extremely clear for conscious beings.
| ***(al-)Alaq***                     | The clot clinging (to the wall of the female womb)
| ***(al-)‚Äòamal***                    | An action, deed
| ***(al-)‚Äòamal as-sƒÅlih***           | Good, righteous deed
| ***(al-)AmƒÅnah***                   | The trust, that is any responsibility or all the duties which either God or society or an individual places in someone‚Äôs charge; the Supreme Trust which only humankind has undertaken, so in this sense, it refers to the human ego
(al-)Amƒ´r: The leader; the commander
(al-)Amr: Command; authority; affair
Amr bi‚Äôl-Ma‚Äòr≈´f: Enjoining and actively promoting what is good and right (in appropriate ways)
(al-)AnsƒÅr: The Helpers. It is particularly used for the Muslims of Madƒ´nah who helped the emigrant Muslims of Makkah in the process of the latter‚Äôs settling down in Madƒ´nah.
(al-)‚ÄòAql: Reasoning and reflecting to make a conclusion and be able to distinguish between what is right and wrong, and between what is beneficial and harmful; in common terminology, it is the intellect which does this reasoning and reflection
(al-)‚ÄòArƒÅf: The Heights (between Paradise and Hell, upon which the believers who still have sins unpardoned will be retained to be forgiven so that they can enter Paradise)
(al-)‚ÄòArsh: The throne; the Supreme Throne of God. As the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn addresses all levels of understanding through all ages, it tends to present certain abstract truths, like those pertaining to Divinity, with concrete expressions, and it uses metaphors and comparisons. It presents the Kursiyy (Seat; see 2: 255) as if it were a platform or seat, and the ‚ÄòArsh as if it were a throne and God were the ruler of the universe seated on His throne, governing all creation. ‚ÄòArsh is the composition of four of God‚Äôs Names: the First, the Last, the All-Outward, and the All-Inward. Also, deducing from Said Nursi‚Äôs description of water as the ‚Äòarsh (throne) of mercy and earth, the throne of life, we can say that the ‚ÄòArsh (Throne) implies God‚Äôs full control of and authority over the universe. Elements such as water and earth are things that conduct God‚Äôs decrees, or media by which the decrees are manifested and executed.
(al-)‚ÄòAsabiyyat (al-JƒÅhiliyyah): Tribal or racial attachment; racism. Islam eradicated all blood-, culture-, language-, and color-based discrimination, condemning it as an attitude arising from sheer ignorance and carnality.
AsbƒÅb an-nuz≈´l: Occasions on which verses of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn were revealed
AshƒÅb al-Kahf: The young people from the royal class of the Romans in Syria-Jordan region who gave up idol-worship and believed in God as the only Deity and Lord, and had to take shelter in a cave. They stayed in the cave in a death-like sleep for 300 years, and then woke up as a sign of resurrection.
AshƒÅb al-Uhd≈´d: A tyrannical people who dug ditches and burnt the believers alive in them.
‚ÄòAshƒÅb al-Yamƒ´n (al-Maymanah): The people of the Right, the people of happiness and prosperity (who will be given their Records in their right hands in the Hereafter)
‚ÄòAshƒÅb ash-ShimƒÅl (al-Mash‚Äôamah): The people of the Left, the people of wretchedness (who will be given their Records in their left hands in the Hereafter)
al-Ashhur al-Hurum: The months of Dhu‚Äôl-Qa‚Äòdah, Dhu‚Äôl-Hijjah, Muharram and Rajab (the 11th, 12th, 1st, and 7th months of the lunar year) during which warfare, killing, and pillage are prohibited.
(al-)AsmƒÅ‚Äô al-HusnƒÅ: The All-Beautiful Names (of God). These Names are either included in the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn or were taught by God‚Äôs Messenger, and God is and should be called by them.
(al-)AsmƒÅ‚Äô wa‚Äôs-SifƒÅt: God‚Äôs Names and Attributes. Besides His Names, God has Attributes. Some Attributes are essential to His being God. They are Existence, Having No Beginning, Permanence, Oneness, Being Unlike the Created, and Self-Subsistence. God has another kind of Attributes, called the Positive Attributes, which describe God as what He is. They are Life, Knowledge, Will, Power, Hearing, Seeing, Speech, and Bringing into Existence. These Attributes are the origin of certain Names such as Giver of Life and the AllReviver, the All-Knowing, the All-Willing, the All-Powerful, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the All-Speaking, and the Creator, etc. Having such absolute, unrestricted Attributes and All-Beautiful Names means that their manifestation is ‚Äúinevitable.‚Äù One Who exists in and of Himself, and Whose Existence is absolutely perfect, will manifest Himself, as ‚Äúrequired‚Äù by His very ‚Äúnature.‚Äù Thus, the universe is the collection of the manifestations of God‚Äôs Attributes and Names, and those manifestations are focused on humankind. God also has a third kind of Attributes which describe what God is not. They are almost endless. For example, God is not One Who begets or is begotten, nor One Who has any partners, nor One who has any need, etc.
(al-)‚ÄòAsr: Time; afternoon; the last part of time replete with important events
(al-)‚ÄòAwrah: Parts of the body that are not supposed to be exposed to others. For men, this is from the navel to the knee. For women, it is the entire body except the hands, feet, and face.
(al-)‚ÄòƒÄyah: A manifest sign; miracle; lesson to be taken from an event; each of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn‚Äôs independent sentences between two points (verses)
ƒÄyƒÅtun bayyinƒÅt: The signs or messages which are clear in meaning and content (as evidence of the truth)
(al-)ƒÄyat al-Kursƒ´yy: The verse of the Divine Seat of Dominion. It is verse 255 of S≈´rat al-Baqarah, which makes God known through some of His Names and Attributes.
AyyƒÅmu‚ÄôllƒÅh: Days of God (momentous historical events such as the destruction of communities, turning-points in history, and eschatological events)
(al-)Baghy: Envious rivalry and insolence (which the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn stresses as being the cardinal reason for internal conflicts in a community)
(al-)BalƒÅ‚Äô: A trial, testing. Although it usually comes in the form of disaster, God tries people with both good and evil. When He tries with good, such as success, wealth, a high position, and physical beauty, it requires gratitude to God and attributing it to Him. When He tries with evil, such as a misfortune, illness or poverty, it requires patience without complaint. This, however, does not mean that one stricken by an evil should not try to escape from it. Being tried with evil may sometimes be the result of a sin. Therefore, it also requires repentance, seeking forgiveness, and reformation.

This falls into two categories. The first category is the active prayer. It means complying with the laws that God has set for life.

The second aspect of the world is the tillage for the Hereafter. The building-blocks which make up one‚Äôs Paradise or Hell in the Hereafter are the seeds of one‚Äôs belief or unbelief, and the deeds that one sows here. The third aspect of the world is that which looks to our carnal desires, passions, lusts and ambitions.

(an-)Nafs: The self of a living being; the faculty (soul) which is the source

element of the Divine Religion. This training, according to some schools in Islam, has ten stages, and according to others and some Qur‚ÄôƒÅnic allusions, seven
stages. If the soul lives only a life of ease in the swamp of carnal appetites, it is
‚Äúthe evil-commanding, carnal soul‚Äù (an-nafs al-ammƒÅrah); if it falters time and
again while following the way of the Religion to attain piety and righteousness,
but each time that it falters it criticizes itself and turns to its Lord, then it is ‚Äúthe
self-accusing soul‚Äù (an-nafs al-lawwƒÅmah). The soul which always resists evil
in devotion to God and is favored with certain Divine gifts in proportion to its
purity is called ‚Äúthe soul receiving inspiration‚Äù (an-nafs al-mulhimah). When it
reaches the point where it has a relation with its Lord in perfect devotion and
sincerity so that its consciousness is at rest, then it is ‚Äúthe soul at rest‚Äù (an-nafs
al-mutmainnah). If it has reached the station where it abandons all its choices
and is a representative of Divine will, it is ‚Äúthe soul pleased with God‚Äù (an-nafs
ar-rƒÅdiyah). When its greatest aim is acquiring God‚Äôs good pleasure and approval and it is always acting to this end in consideration of, ‚ÄúI am pleased with
You, so be pleased with me,‚Äù then it is ‚Äúthe soul with which God is pleased‚Äù
(an-nafs al-mardiyyah). Finally, the soul which has been perfectly purified of
all sins and evil morals and has the capacity to be completely adorned with the
full manifestations of Divine Qualities and Prophetic will-power and resolution
is called ‚Äúthe soul perfected‚Äù or ‚Äúthe soul pure‚Äù (an-nafs az-zakiyyah or an-nafs
as-sƒÅfiyah).
