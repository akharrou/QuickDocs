		\subsection{Declaration} % [Search Tags: >declaration]

			% This subsection will tackle the idea that we have that makes us error prone and help us develoop a new brain and things of that nature. The key precepts that i want to touch on are the following:

			% 	> "He who asks a question now risks being a fool once. He who doesn't ask a question risks being a fool for a lifetime" -- Confucious

			% 	> "The real reason we do things is because we are scared that they will not work and hence we ask ourselves the question of why." -- Confucious

		\subsection{Definition} % [Search Tags: >definition]

			The thing that I think we ought to do is recant how concise the connession was. The reason I think we should do that is because This is just a test dry run typing some words on my computer making sure that this works and how smooth this is and isn't but at the same time i wasnt really sure whether or not i wanted to do this or if i had more on the table or the thing that bothers mr the most is the fact that it seems to me that my left hand is doing much of the heavy lifting and my other right hand is not doing it and so it is kind of weird to be completely honest and well i wish i could fix this or at least figure out how to solve this and much more problems and things related to this issue and things i could not even remember how they worked or anything like that and much much more things that i could not even really talk about if not because we are in the public sphere and there is a problem of transperancy in it.

		\subsection{Definition} % [Search Tags: >definition]

			This is a new paragraph in which i will write a new idea that i think is worth sharing with the world and that the world might like and appreciate and find useful.
