### Welcome !

*[To the]* ***Home of QuickDocs*** –– Quickly Searchable, Clickable,
Reference-able Documentation, that keeps, for each of its treated subject
matters, a table of the best references/resources out there.

### How to quickly find anything ?

In every QuickDoc there are search tags under each section title. These search tags
were designed with the idea of making anything quick, easy and intuitive to find.

```
### Section Title
[Search Tags: >fulltagname >tagname >tag >tname >fulltname ...]
```

These search tags are meant to be searched with the help of your browser's `find`
bar. To bring out the `find` bar, press ***`cmd+f`***. The search tags within each
QuickDoc follow the **form**:

```
>topicmatterdesired
>topic.matter.desired
```

> –– so every search should follow that form.
> It should be prepended with a right arrow character
> '`>`', followed by the full subject matter word or phrase
> or abbreviation/acrynom thereof, with no spaces in
> between; occaisonnaly there will be additionally search tags that may be
> seperated with a dot/period character '`.`'.
>
> Feel free to suggest other search tags for any subject matter [as a pull request] and they will promptly be added !
