### Welcome !

*[To the]* ***Home of QuickDocs*** –– Quickly Searchable, Clickable,
Reference-able Documentation, that keeps for each of its treated subject
matters, a table of the best references/resources out there.

### How to search ?

- To initiate a search, you may use your *[browser's]* `find`
  command –– for most, that command will be: ***`cmd+f`***.

  Every search should follow the **form**:

  ```
  >topicmatterdesired
  ```

  or

  ```
  >topic.matter.desired
  ```

  > –– the search should be prepended with a right arrow character
  > '`>`', followed by the full subject matter word or phrase
  > or abbreviation/acrynom thereof, with no spaces in
  > between; occaisonnaly there will be search tags that may be
  > seperated with a dot/period character '`.`'.
  >
  > Feel free to suggest other search tags for any subject matter.
