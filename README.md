### How to quickly find anything ?

In every QuickDoc there are search tags under each section title that were designed
to hopefully make anything quickly findable. To find then a particular subject matter,
you can initiate an [in document] search. Your browser command usually has that under
mapped to the key combination: ***`cmd+f`***. The search tags within each QuickDoc
follow the **form**:

```
>topicmatterdesired
>topic.matter.desired
```

> –– so every search should follow that form.
> It should be prepended with a right arrow character
> '`>`', followed by the full subject matter word or phrase
> or abbreviation/acrynom thereof, with no spaces in
> between; occaisonnaly there will be additionally search tags that may be
> seperated with a dot/period character '`.`'.
>
> Feel free to suggest other search tags for any subject matter.
