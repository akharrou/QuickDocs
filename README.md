### Welcome !

*[To the]* ***Home of QuickDocs*** –– Quickly Searchable, Clickable,
Reference-able Documentation, that keeps, for each of its treated subject
matters, a table of the best references/resources out there.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### How to quickly find anything ?

You can initiate a search. To do so, you can use your *[browser's]* command that
brings out the [in document] search bar –– for most, that command will be:
***`cmd+f`***. In every QuickDoc there are search tags under each section
title they follow the **form**:

```
>topicmatterdesired
>topic.matter.desired
```

> –– every search should then be prepended with a right arrow character
> '`>`', followed by the full subject matter word or phrase
> or abbreviation/acrynom thereof, with no spaces in
> between; occaisonnaly there will be search tags that may be
> seperated with a dot/period character '`.`'.
>
> Feel free to suggest other search tags for any subject matter.
