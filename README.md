### How to quickly find anything ?

In every QuickDoc there are search tags under each section title. These search tags
were designed with the idea of making anything quick, easy and intuitive to find.

```
### Section Title
[Search Tags: >fulltagname >tagname >tag >tname >fulltname ...]
```

These search tags are meant to be searched with the help of your browser's `find`
bar. To bring out the `find` bar, press ***`cmd+f`***. The search tags within each
QuickDoc follow the **form**:

```
>topicmatterdesired
>topic.matter.desired
```

> –– a right arrow character '`>`', followed by the full subject matter word/phrase
> or abbreviation/acronyms thereof or combination thereof of word/phrase/abrv./acronyms,
> with no spaces in between; occaisonnaly there will be additionally search tags that may
> be seperated with a dot/period character '`.`'.

> Feel free to suggest other search tags for any subject matter *[as a pull request]* and they will promptly be added !
