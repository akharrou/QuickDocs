# 1. Document Structure
<small>`[Search Tags: >docstructure >docstructs >docstrcts >documentstructures]`</small>
<br>

>	*The main objective in writing is to convey ideas, information, or knowledge to the reader. The better these ideas are structured, the better the reader will understand and retain them. And in addition, the more the typographical form reflects this logical/semantic structure, the better this structure will appear and be felt [by the reader]*
>
>	*This is where LaTeX, in contrast to other typesetting systems, shines. LaTeX allows you to simply tell it the logical/semantical structure of the text that you want, using commands DO (e.g. `\part{}`, `\chapter{}`, `\section{}`). It then derives the typographical form of the text according to the ‚Äúrules‚Äù given in the _document class file_ (and in various style files).*
>
>	*LaTeX allows users to structure their documents with a variety of hierarchical constructs, including parts, chapters, sections, subsections, paragraphs and even subparagraphs.*

# 2. Preamble
<small>`[Search Tags: >preamble >perambule]`</small>

The preambule area is meant to be a place where **things affecting the entire document** are supposed to be declared / defined. Things like, the **document class** ([¬ß2.1](#21-document-classes)) and **packages** ([¬ß2.2](#22-packages)) which we will discuss below.

## 2.1. Document classes
<small>`[Search Tags: >documentclass >docclass >init >documentclass >docclass >doclass >classes >doctype >doclayoutclass >doclasslayout >layout]`</small>
<br>
<br>

-	A ***document class*** is an abstraction ‚Äì of a set of commands <!--(¬ß SECTION )-->, defined in a file, governing a documents' typographical form (i.e layout, style, etc), when imported.

-	A *document class* is defined in a ***document class file*** ‚Äì a file with a `.cls` extention (name), containing "rules" that describe *[to the LaTeX processor]* the typographical form of a document ‚Äì i.e how to format a document, i.e how to make it look in print.

-	***To specify which document class [to use]:***
	```latex
	\documentclass[<options>]{<class>}
	```
	> ‚Äì write the above command at the very top of your document.

	**Example:**
	```latex
	\documentclass[12pt, a4paper, oneside, draft]{report}
	```

<br>

Replace the `<class>` field with one of the following **standard document classes**:

Class     | Description
----------|--------------
`article` | For articles in scientific journals, presentations, short reports, program documentation, invitations, ...
`IEEEtran` | For articles with the IEEE Transactions format.
`proc` | A class for proceedings based on the article class.
`report` | For longer reports containing several chapters, small books, thesis, ...
`book` | For real books.
`slides` | For slides. The class uses big sans serif letters.
`memoir` | For changing sensibly the output of the document. It is based on the `book` class, but you can create any kind of document with it
`letter` | For writing letters.
`beamer` | For writing presentations (see [LaTeX/Presentations](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Presentations)).

<small>`[Search Tags: >documentoptions >docoptions >documentoptions >docoptions >dooptions >optionses >doclayoutoptions >dooptionslayout >docops >layoutoptions >layoutops]`</small>

... and replace the `<option>` field with one or more of the common **class options**:

Option | Description
-------|--------------
`10pt`, `11pt`,`12pt` | Sets the size of the main font in the document. If no     option is specified, 10pt is assumed.
`a4paper`, `letterpaper`, <br>... | Defines the paper size. The default size is     `letterpaper`; However, many European distributions of TeX now come pre-set     for A4, not Letter, and this is also true of all distributions of pdfLaTeX.     Besides that, `a5paper`, `b5paper`, `executivepaper`, and `legalpaper` can be     specified.
`fleqn` | Typesets displayed formulas left-aligned instead of centered.
`leqno` | Places the numbering of formulas on the left hand side instead of the     right.
`titlepage`, `notitlepage` | Specifies whether a new page should be started     after the document title or not. The article class does not start a new     page by default, while report and book do.
`twocolumn` | Instructs LaTeX to typeset the document in two columns instead of     one.
`twoside`, oneside | Specifies whether double or single sided output should be     generated. The classes `article` and `report` are single sided and the `book`     class is double sided by default. Note that this option concerns the style     of the document only. The option `twoside` does not tell the printer you use     that it should actually make a two-sided printout.
`landscape` | Changes the layout of the document to print in landscape mode.
`openright`, `openany` | Makes chapters begin either only on right hand pages     or on the next page available. This does not work with the `article` class,     as it does not know about chapters. The `report` class by default starts     chapters on the next page available and the `book` class starts them on right     hand pages.
`draft` | Makes LaTeX indicate hyphenation and justification problems with a     small square in the right-hand margin of the problem line so they can be     located quickly by a human. It also suppresses the inclusion of images and     shows only a frame where they would normally occur.

-	Non-generic classes (e.g. some provided by university departments or publication houses) may have different options than those shown above or no options at all. Normally, third-party classes come with their own documentation.

	>	A [document] class's documentation (and other relevant information) can be found (and downloaded) on the ‚Äì [Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN)](https://ctan.org) ‚Äì *"central place for all kinds of material around TeX"*.

-	It is also possible to create & use your own *document class(es)*.

<br>
<br>

-	A **pacakge** is an abstraction ‚Äì of a set of commands <!--(¬ß SECTION )--> and macros <!--(¬ß SECTION )-->, defined in a file, that add features and functionalities *[to the LaTeX processor]*, when imported, giving you new or enhanced capabilties. Packages are imported ‚Äì *so to speak* ‚Äì independantly from *document classes*.

-	A *package* is defined in a ***package file*** ‚Äì a file with a `.sty` extention (name), containing commands and macros, that extend LaTeX's *[processor]* capabilties.

-	***To use packages:***
	```latex
	\usepackage[<options>]{<package>}
	```
	> ‚Äì write the above command at the top of your file, after the `\documentclass[]{}` command.

	**Example:**
	```latex
	\documentclass[12pt, a4paper, oneside, draft]{report}

	\usepackage[ampersand]{easylist}  % Introduces an Enhanced & (More) Flexible Enums/Lists
	\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}       % Added [UTF8] (Input) Encoding Capability
	\usepackage{tasks}                % Added Horizontal Enum Items Capability
	\usepackage{amsmath}              % Added Math Capabilities
	...
	```

-	Each package comes with its documentation. In it is specified the option(s) that come with it *[the package]* and that can be used *[in the `<options>` field]* when importing it *[the package]*, via `\usepackage[]{}`. <br>

	Package documentation also details the added features and functionalities *[to the LaTeX processor]* and how to use them *[in your document]*.

	>	A package's documentation (and other relevant information) can be found (and downloaded) on the ‚Äì [Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN)](https://ctan.org) ‚Äì *"central place for all kinds of material around TeX. CTAN has currently 5781 packages. 2651 contributors have contributed to it. Most of the packages are free and can be downloaded and used immediately"*.

## 3.1. Top matter
<small>`[Search Tags: >topmatter >top.matter >matter.top >document.topmatter >doctopmatter >docmattertop >doc.topmatter]`</small>
<br>
<br>

-	***Top matter:***

	```latex

	% Preamble

	\begin{document}

	\title     {<title>}
	\author    {<author>}
	\date      {<date>}
	\maketitle

	\end{document}
	```

	‚Äì refers to all of the information about the document itself: title, date, and also information about the author(s): name, address, email, etc.

	> The above commands: `\title{}`, `\author{}`, and `\date{}` do as they advertise. Write between their curly brackets, the required information.
	>
	> With regards to the `\date` command; <br>
	>	-	omitting it (i.e not writing it at all),  causes LaTeX to typeset the title with the current day's date. <br>
	>	-	leaving the curly brackets blank (e.g. `\date{}`) causes LaTeX to typeset the title without any date.
	>
	> `\maketitle` is the command that informs, the *[LaTeX]* processor to typeset *(i.e process for printing)* the title. Omitting it, causes LaTeX to omit typesetting the title.
	>
	> *<small>[Note:*
	> -	In this manner, you can only create titles with a fixed layout. To have greater flexibility, see the Title Creation ([¬ß11](#11-title-creation)). <br>
	> -	You should remember, however, that the goal of LaTeX is to leave formatting to the documentclass designer, and if you wish to submit your work to multiple publishers then you should avoid designing a custom title.
